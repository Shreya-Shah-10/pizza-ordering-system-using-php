VALUES 
(1, 'Preheat Your Oven Fully', 
'1. Always Preheat Fully
--> Set your oven to 220–250°C (430–480°F) depending on your recipe.
--> Wait until it fully reaches the temperature before putting the pizza in. A properly preheated oven ensures a crispy base and evenly melted cheese.

2. Use a Pizza Stone or Steel
--> Place a pizza stone or baking steel in the oven while preheating.
--> These hold heat and give your pizza that classic crispy, restaurant-style crust.

3. Preheat for 20–30 Minutes
--> Even if your oven shows it’s hot, the stone or steel needs extra time to get fully heated.
--> This prevents soggy dough.

4. Top Rack vs. Bottom Rack
--> Use the middle or lower-middle rack for even cooking.
--> If you like a crispier base, bake closer to the bottom heating element.

5. Avoid Opening the Door Too Often
--> Each time you open the oven, the temperature drops.
--> Slide your pizza in quickly to maintain heat.

6. Check with a Thermometer (optional but pro tip)
--> Oven dials are often inaccurate. Use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven really is at the right temperature.

7. For Multiple Pizzas
--> Preheat once, then bake pizzas one after another.
--> If you’re baking several at once, rotate them halfway through so they cook evenly.

8. Use Baking Paper (Optional)
--> Place your dough on parchment paper to transfer easily into the oven.
--> It prevents sticking and keeps the base neat.

9. Don’t Overload Toppings
--> Too many toppings release excess moisture.
--> Keep it balanced for a crisp crust and well-baked toppings.

10. Give the Crust a Boost
--> Brush the edges with olive oil or garlic butter before baking.
--> This adds flavor and helps the crust turn golden brown.

11. Rest the Pizza Before Slicing
--> Let your pizza rest for 2–3 minutes after baking.
--> This keeps the cheese from sliding off and makes cutting easier.

12. Reheating Tip
--> For leftovers, reheat slices directly on a pan or in the oven, not the microwave.
--> This restores crispiness instead of making the crust soggy.',

VALUES 
(2, 'Use a Pizza Stone', 
'1. Preheat the Stone
--> Always place the pizza stone in the oven before turning it on.
--> Let it preheat for at least 30–45 minutes at 230–260°C (450–500°F).
--> A hot stone mimics the floor of a traditional brick oven, giving your crust that crispy bottom.

2. Never Put Cold Stone in Hot Oven
--> A sudden temperature change can crack the stone.
--> Always let the stone heat up gradually with the oven.

3. Use Parchment Paper or a Pizza Peel
--> To prevent sticking, place your pizza on parchment paper or use a lightly floured pizza peel to slide it onto the stone.
--> Avoid excess flour or cornmeal — it can burn and smoke.

4. Thin Crust Advantage
--> Pizza stones are especially good for thin crust pizzas because they crisp the dough quickly while keeping the inside soft.

5. Avoid Overloading with Toppings
--> Too many toppings release moisture and make the pizza soggy, even on a stone.
--> Keep toppings balanced for best results.

6. Reheating with a Stone
--> You can also reheat leftover pizza on a preheated stone for 5–7 minutes.
--> This keeps it crispy instead of rubbery.

7. Cleaning Your Pizza Stone
--> Never wash with soap (the stone absorbs it).
--> Scrape off bits with a brush or scraper.
--> If stained, that’s okay — it adds seasoning like a cast-iron pan.',

VALUES 
(3, 'Don’t Overload Toppings', 
'1. Less is More
--> A pizza should have a balance of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.
--> Too many toppings make the pizza heavy and soggy, preventing the crust from cooking properly.

2. Limit the Variety
--> Stick to 3–4 toppings maximum (not counting cheese and sauce).
--> Too many flavors fight each other instead of blending.

3. Distribute Evenly
--> Spread toppings in a thin, even layer.
--> This ensures every slice gets a bit of everything and cooks evenly.

4. Pre-Cook Moist Ingredients
--> Veggies like mushrooms, onions, and spinach release water while baking.
--> Lightly sauté or roast them first to avoid a watery pizza.

5. Use Cheese Wisely
--> Cheese counts as a topping too — don’t pile it too thick.
--> A moderate layer melts better and gives that stretchy texture without drowning the crust.

6. Mind the Oven Heat
--> Overloaded toppings insulate the dough, so the base stays raw while the top burns.
--> A lighter topping load ensures the crust crisps up beautifully.

7. Think Like a Pizzeria
--> Most restaurant pizzas look “light” on toppings compared to homemade ones.
--> That’s why they cook faster, crispier, and taste balanced.',

VALUES 
(4, 'Use Fresh Herbs', 
'1. Add After Baking (Mostly)
--> Many fresh herbs (like basil, cilantro, parsley) lose flavor and turn bitter if baked too long.
--> Add them right after the pizza comes out of the oven for a burst of freshness.

2. Use Hardy Herbs Before Baking
--> Stronger herbs like rosemary, thyme, oregano, sage can handle oven heat.
--> Sprinkle them lightly before baking for deep, roasted flavors.

3. Balance the Flavors
--> Fresh herbs enhance pizza by lifting flavors without overpowering.
--> A few leaves of basil or a pinch of fresh oregano is enough.

4. Tear, Don’t Chop
--> For basil and soft herbs, tear by hand instead of chopping with a knife.
--> This preserves essential oils and keeps the flavor stronger.

5. Make Herb Oils
--> Infuse olive oil with garlic + basil/rosemary/oregano and drizzle it on your pizza before serving.
--> Adds aroma and richness without overloading toppings.

6. Pair Herbs with Toppings
--> Basil → perfect with tomato & mozzarella (classic Margherita).
--> Rosemary → great with potato, sausage, or mushrooms.
--> Cilantro → works well with spicy or BBQ-style pizzas.
--> Parsley → balances cheesy or meat-heavy pizzas.

7. Don’t Use Dried as a Substitute (if possible)
--> Dried herbs have a different, muted flavor.
--> Fresh herbs add brightness and aroma that dried can’t match.',

INSERT INTO cooking_tips_tbl (tip_id, tip_title, tip_content, tip_photo, admin_id)
VALUES 
(5, 'Let Dough Rest', 
'1. Why Resting Matters
--> Resting allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to stretch without snapping back.
--> It also lets the yeast continue fermenting, which develops flavor and improves texture.

2. First Rest (Bulk Fermentation)
--> After kneading, let the dough rest for 1–2 hours at room temperature (or until it doubles in size).
--> This creates lightness and air bubbles in the crust.

3. Second Rest (Ball Resting)
--> Divide the dough into balls, cover them, and rest for 20–30 minutes before shaping.
--> This short rest makes the dough more elastic and easier to stretch thin.

4. Overnight Rest for Best Flavor
--> For a deeper flavor, let the dough cold ferment in the fridge for 12–24 hours.
--> Slow fermentation develops a slightly tangy, pizzeria-style crust.

5. Cover to Prevent Drying
--> Always cover resting dough with a damp cloth, plastic wrap, or lid.
--> Exposed dough dries out, forming a crusty skin that ruins the texture.

6. Room Temperature Before Baking
--> If you rested dough in the fridge, bring it back to room temperature for 30–60 minutes before shaping.
--> Cold dough is stiff and harder to stretch.

7. Be Patient
--> Rushing this step often results in dense, tough pizza crust.
--> Resting is as important as kneading!',

INSERT INTO cooking_tips_tbl (tip_id, tip_title, tip_content, tip_photo, admin_id)
VALUES 
(6, 'Use Bread Flour', 
'1. Higher Protein = Better Gluten
--> Bread flour has 12–14% protein, compared to all-purpose flour’s 9–11%.
--> More protein means more gluten development, giving your pizza dough better structure and chew.

2. Chewier, Stronger Crust
--> If you love that New York–style pizza chewiness, bread flour is the way to go.
--> It holds up better to stretching and doesn’t tear easily.

3. Better Rise
--> The strong gluten network traps more gas from yeast.
--> This gives your pizza light, airy bubbles in the crust.

4. Crispier Bottom
--> Bread flour absorbs less water than all-purpose, so your pizza bakes with a crisp bottom while staying soft inside.

5. Easier to Stretch
--> Bread flour dough is more elastic, meaning it stretches thin without breaking.
--> Great for hand-tossing and shaping into large pizzas.

6. Hydration Adjustment
--> Bread flour can handle slightly more water (higher hydration dough).
--> Try 60–65% hydration (water weight as a % of flour weight) for soft but strong dough.

7. Mix with Other Flours (Optional)
--> Want softer crust? Mix bread flour + all-purpose.
--> Want rustic flavor? Mix bread flour + whole wheat.

8. Don’t Worry if You Don’t Have It
--> All-purpose flour works fine for beginners.
--> But once you try bread flour, you’ll notice the difference in texture, stretch, and flavor.',

INSERT INTO cooking_tips_tbl (tip_id, tip_title, tip_content, tip_photo, admin_id)
VALUES 
(7, 'Stretch, Don’t Roll', 
'1. Why Not Roll?
--> Rolling with a pin pushes out all the air bubbles that yeast created during fermentation.
--> This leads to a dense, flat crust instead of a light, airy one.

2. Stretching Keeps the Air
--> Hand-stretching preserves those little gas pockets, giving you a puffier, chewier edge (cornicione) like in pizzerias.

3. Room-Temperature Dough
--> Cold dough resists stretching and shrinks back.
--> Let your dough sit at room temp for 30–60 minutes before shaping.

4. Flour Your Hands & Surface
--> Lightly flour to prevent sticking, but don’t overdo it — too much flour can dry the dough.

5. How to Stretch Properly
--> Start by pressing the center outward with your fingers, leaving a thicker edge.
--> Pick it up and use the backs of your hands/knuckles to gently stretch, letting gravity help.
--> Rotate slowly until it’s the size you want.

6. Don’t Worry About Perfect Circles
--> Rustic, slightly uneven pizzas actually look more authentic.
--> What matters is even thickness, not shape.

7. If It Tears
--> Just pinch the hole closed and keep stretching gently.
--> Dough tearing usually means it needs more resting time.

8. Practice Makes Perfect
--> The first few tries may be tricky, but soon you’ll stretch dough without even thinking.',

VALUES 
(8, 'Make Sauce From Scratch', 
'1. Use Good Tomatoes
--> Start with San Marzano or any high-quality canned plum tomatoes.
--> Fresh ripe tomatoes also work, but canned are more consistent year-round.

2. Keep It Simple
--> A great pizza sauce doesn’t need cooking (for Neapolitan-style).
--> Just blend tomatoes + salt + olive oil — that’s it.
--> Cooking is optional if you prefer a deeper, sweeter flavor.

3. Season Lightly
--> Classic seasoning: salt, olive oil, garlic, oregano, and fresh basil.
--> Avoid over-spicing; the sauce should complement, not overpower the cheese and crust.

4. No Watering Down
--> Drain canned tomatoes slightly if too watery.
--> A thick sauce prevents soggy pizza.

5. Raw vs. Cooked Sauce
--> Raw Sauce: Fresh, tangy, bright (used in authentic Neapolitan pizza).
--> Cooked Sauce: Sweeter, richer, with caramelized garlic & onions (used in American/New York style).

6. Blend or Crush by Hand
--> For smooth sauce → use a blender.
--> For rustic texture → crush tomatoes by hand.

7. Make Ahead for Better Flavor
--> Let the sauce rest for a few hours or overnight in the fridge.
--> The flavors meld together and taste more balanced.

8. Use Sparingly
--> Don’t drown your pizza in sauce.
--> A thin, even layer is enough for flavor without making the crust soggy.',

INSERT INTO cooking_tips_tbl (tip_id, tip_title, tip_content, tip_photo, admin_id)
VALUES 
(9, 'Add Cornmeal to Peel', 
'1. Why Use Cornmeal?
--> Sprinkling cornmeal on your pizza peel (or baking sheet) acts like tiny ball bearings, helping the pizza slide smoothly into the oven.
--> It also prevents sticking, even with wetter doughs.

2. Extra Crunch & Flavor
--> Cornmeal adds a subtle crunch and a hint of nutty flavor to the crust bottom.
--> It’s a signature touch in many pizzerias.

3. How Much to Use
--> A light sprinkle is enough — too much can burn and leave a gritty texture.
--> Think of it like dusting flour, but with more sliding power.

4. Alternatives to Cornmeal
--> Semolina flour (coarse) — same effect, slightly less gritty.
--> Regular flour — works, but less effective for sliding.
--> Parchment paper — easiest option for beginners (no sticking at all, just bake right on it).

5. Load Quickly
--> Even with cornmeal, don’t let the pizza sit too long on the peel.
--> The dough can still stick if it rests and absorbs moisture.

6. Check Before Sliding
--> Gently shake the peel before launching.
--> If the pizza moves freely, it’s ready. If not, lift and dust a little more cornmeal underneath.

7. Clean the Stone After
--> Some cornmeal will burn on your stone/steel.
--> Brush it off after baking to keep future pizzas from tasting bitter.',

VALUES 
(10, 'Rest Pizza After Baking', 
'1. Why Rest?
--> Fresh out of the oven, the cheese and toppings are extremely hot and runny.
--> Resting for a few minutes lets everything set slightly, so toppings don’t slide off when you cut it.

2. Ideal Resting Time
--> 2–3 minutes is enough.
--> You don’t want it to cool completely — just settle.

3. Better Cutting
--> Slicing immediately can cause cheese and sauce to ooze everywhere.
--> Resting helps the crust stay crisp while the toppings firm up.

4. Keeps Crust Crispier
--> Right out of the oven, steam is trapped inside the dough.
--> A short rest allows steam to escape, keeping the bottom crust from going soggy.

5. Avoid Over-Resting
--> More than 5 minutes and the pizza may lose its ideal temperature.
--> The goal is warm and melty — not lukewarm.

6. Where to Rest It
--> Rest on a wire cooling rack or cutting board, not in the pan.
--> This prevents condensation underneath that can soften the crust.

7. Extra Flavor Boost
--> Resting is the perfect time to finish with fresh herbs, a drizzle of olive oil, or chili flakes — they stick better once the cheese settles.',
